 *
 * Responses to some requests cannot carry content. An empty 'content'
 * is returned in those situations, and the application must close it
 * when the message is no longer needed.
 *

 *
 *   1. content_length >= 0:
 *      - the given number of bytes are delivered as-is
 *   2. content_length == HTTP_DECODE_CHUNKED:
 *      - chunked decoding is performed and the decoded bytes delivered
 *   3. content_length == HTTP_DECODE_EXHAUST:
 *      - the remainder of the stream is delivered unprocessed as
 *        content
 *   4. content_length == HTTP_DECODE_OBEY_HEADER:
 *      - if the envelope contains a "Content-length: <n>" header,
 *        perform as though content_length == n
 *      - if the envelope contains a "Transfer-encoding: chunked"
 *        header, perform as though content_length ==
 *        HTTP_ENCODE_CHUNKED
 *      - otherwise, perform as though
 *        content_length == HTTP_DECODE_EXHAUST
 *
 * After 'content' returns an end-of-stream, the dequeued envelope may
 * contain trailer fields.
 *
 * Normally, returns a nonnegative value. If HTTP_DECODE_OBEY_HEADER is
 * specified, http_decoder_get_content() may return a negative number
 * (with errno == EPROTO) as a sign of a fatal protocol error. */
