 *      - deliver 'content' unprocessed

 *   2. content_length == HTTP_ENCODE_CHUNKED:
 *      - encode a "Transfer-encoding: chunked" field as part of the
 *        envelope header
 *      - perform chunked encoding on 'content'
 *      - after exhausting 'content'--but before closing it--deliver
 *        the envelope trailer (*)
 *   3. content_length == HTTP_ENCODE_RAW:
 *      - do not add fields to the envelope header
 *      - deliver 'content' unprocessed
 *      - ignore the envelope trailer
 *
 * Note that it is possible to generate an illegal HTTP message.
 *
 * (*) The envelope trailer can be amended with http_env_add_trailer() up
 * to the point when 'content' returns an end-of-stream. You can "buy
 * time" by having 'content' return EAGAIN until the trailers have been
 * added to 'envelope'. */
